This site is a place to stick some ideas and put stuff on line.

most of it is things i want to show my kids.

* litebrite = a simple web based version of the orignal toy for my girl
* tic tac toe = my little girl out grew this fast but my son is learning to play now
* asteroids = me honing my js skills, playing with canvas
* catapult = first attempt at making a js and canvas game. not complete needs lots of work
* tix = digital version of the now defunct tix clock. check out my blog to learn about the physical one i built
* ciphers. my girl is into codes right now. caesar and vigenere. don't use to hide stuff from the government.
